incomplete README, they will assume that your code is also messy or incomplete. But if you have a README with clean formatting and clear setup instructions, your users will have more confidence in trying out your software - and in trying you out, too, if they're an employer looking to hire!

Below, we've included the basic template used in the Northwest Gardener README above. You can copy and paste the text below into a new file and replace the relevant parts that are mentioned in curly brackets with information about your project. Don't include the curly brackets in your README - instead, replace with your individualized content. You are welcome to add additional sections and content to your README as needed - just make sure that at a minimum, your READMEs include the content in this template.
